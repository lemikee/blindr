# Blindr

## Overview
Looking for jobs can be a long and tedious process; Personalized cover letters, networking and coding challenges take a lot of time and are really only worth it for companies you like and want to work with. Enter Blindr!! Our app aims to disrupt the traditional gateway into a company by targeting job openings that you are not only qualified for but compelled by. Using state-of-the-art UI, job seekers can select their preferences and skills and then swipe left or right to either begin a conversation with a recruiter for that specific job or move on to the next opportunity. Never before has so much power been in the hands of job seekers; Now is your time. Don't waste a second!

## Technologies

This Javascript project runs on the MERN stack. For the backend, we leveraged Express.js and Node.js as a standard way of implementing Mongo API requests to store and retrieve user, job and employer data. On the frontend, we utilized the modern React.js and Redux combination to provide a supplimental frontend application state and limit the amount of re-rendering necessary to display information.

## Functionality

### User/Employer Authentication

### User/Employer Profile

### Matching

### Chatting

## Coordinating with a team
Creating a Full Stack MERN project can be heady enough. But then having to coordinate with a team of four adds another level to that complexity. We split the team into four roles: Team Lead (Mike Le), Frontend Lead (Joey Fernandez), Backend Lead (Joshua Kim-Biggs) and Flex i.e front and backend (Joshua Zhao)
